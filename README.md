# SmartTank

![mainScreenshot](screenshots/mainScreenshot.png)

Automatically scale tanks from ProceduralParts to fit a specified TWR.

## Dependencies

This mod will do nothing unless you install **all** of the dependencies!

- [Module Manager](https://github.com/sarbian/ModuleManager) ([forum thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/50533-130-module-manager-280-may-26th-2017-better-late-than-never/))
- [Procedural Parts](https://github.com/Starwaster/ProceduralParts) ([forum thread](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/162105-130-procedural-parts-starwaster-branch/))

Kerbal Engineer Redux is not required. We use our own modified version of KER's vessel simulator, embedded in the main DLL.

## Download

The [latest version](https://github.com/HebaruSan/SmartTank/releases/latest) is available on Github.

Unzip to your GameData folder.

## Localization

See the [lang folder](https://github.com/HebaruSan/SmartTank/tree/master/assets/lang).

## Known limitations

- Diameter auto-sizing assumes you orient the parts normally; it will not work properly if you flip them upside down before attaching them.
- I have not tested with Real Fuels or other parts of Realism Overhaul. I've tried to do things generically wherever possible, so it might work, but it might not.

## Future plans

See [TODO.md](TODO.md).
