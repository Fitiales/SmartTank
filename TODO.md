# TODO

## Calculation

- [ ] Determine optimal fuel mass per stage
- [ ] Associate each tank with the stage in which it is emptied
- [ ] Split fuel among tanks in the same stage
- [ ] If changes needed, stop iterating to let the simulator re-run

## Auto fitting

- [ ] Set top and bottom diameters to match attached parts
- [ ] Set length to fit ideal fuel mass per stage
- [ ] Set tank type to LF-only when only drained by NERVA, mixed for normal engines

## Part right click menus

- [ ] Auto-scale toggle button
- [ ] Auto-scale Now button
- [ ] Target TWR
- [ ] Toggle diameter matching
- [ ] Toggle fuel matching

## Global settings

- [ ] Default auto-scale ON/off
- [ ] Default target TWR (1.5)
- [ ] Default diameter matching ON/off
- [ ] Default fuel matching ON/off

## Dependency handling

- [ ] Check for dependencies at run time
- [ ] Basic DeltaV dependency option

## Future / limitations

- [ ] Solid fuel
- [ ] Xenon
- [ ] Monopropellant
