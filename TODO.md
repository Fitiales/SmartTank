# TODO

## Fixes

- [ ] Oscillating big/tiny tanks in stage-and-a-half configurations
- [ ] Flickering of tank sizes
- [ ] Auto scaling stops working in certain cases
- [ ] KER fails to calculate in some crossfeed configurations
- [ ] Freeze on re-root
- [ ] Attached parts rendered with offset from joint in some symmetry configurations

## Calculation

- [ ] Get precise diameters if next to other procedural parts

## Auto size more procedural parts

- [ ] Solid fuel
- [ ] Xenon / Electric Charge
- [ ] Monopropellant
- [ ] Decouplers

## Code style

- [ ] Get the density numbers cleanly
- [ ] Search the AttachNodes properly

## UI clean-up

- [ ] Propagate right click settings across all tanks in a stage
  - [ ] Or use global settings as tiebreakers
