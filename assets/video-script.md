## Setup

- UI Scale 150%
- Texture: VensRevampShort
- Target TWR: 1.5
- Prefab:
  - Mk1-2 pod
  - Shielded docking port
  - Parachutes

## Intro

1. Start recording at KSC
2. Superimpose list of installed mods
   - Procedural Parts
   - Ven's Style Procedural Part Textures
   - MainSailor's Textures for Procedural Parts
   - Kerbal Engineer Redux
   - Smart Tank
3. Click on VAB

## Build upper stage (fast-forward in post)

1. Mk1-2 pod
   - Explain KER window
2. Set 2x symmetry
3. Parachutes
4. Shielded docking port
5. Decoupler under it
6. Procedural fuel tank under that
7. Poodle
8. 1x6 non-retractable solar panels
9. 4 RCS quads

## Build sustainer stage

1. Decoupler
2. Procedural fuel tank
3. Mainsail

## Extend with crossfeed

1. Set angle snap
2. Radial decoupler
3. Procedural tank on radial decoupler
4. Fueled nose cone on top of nacelles
5. Set nose cone texture to Tiles
6. Set nose cone diameter to 1.875m
7. Set nose cone length to 1m or 2m
8. Place fuel line from outer tank to inner
9. Place Mainsail at bottom of outer nacelle
10. Adjust staging so three bottom engines start together

## Fine tune TWRs

1. Right click top tank
2. Turn off Atmospheric TWR
3. Reduce TWR to 1.0
4. Right click sustainer tank
5. Reduce TWR to 1.2
6. Landing legs

## Global settings

1. Hover the toolbar button
2. Click toolbar button
3. Hover each option in the settings window
4. Toggle hide fuel tank setting twice
5. Change the default texture

# Errors in attempts

## Attempt 1

- No voice narration (mic works!)
- No game sound (try Pulseaudio settings)
- No parachutes or docking port on pod (prefabs?)
- The huge/tiny tank oscillation, with drop tanks with no fuel lines
- Too much fidgeting and clicking, esp w/ nosecones
- Not enough time to see the right click options
- Deleted the nacelles
- Start with a default texture
- Couldn't remember that ctrl-alt-s stops recording

## Attempt 2

- Still no voice narration
- Recorded part of a podcast
- Recorded pavucontrol (unavoidable?)
- Closed the popup between nosecone texture selection and diameter adjustment
- Set cone length right after diameter
- Only set cone diameter once
- Adjusted staging before fuel lines
- Don't worry about textures until the settings part
- No settings window
- Don't change atmo or TWR till the end
- Don't translate parts till after that
- Use simplified KER
- No asparagus
- Pause at the end for outro

## Attempt 3

- Still no voice narration
- Still not simplified KER
- No landing legs
- Hovered the settings awkwardly
- Accidentally clicked the inline docking port
- Avoid the big tank thing, add fuel lines before adding nacelle engines

## Attempt 4

- Settings tooltip title missing version
- Wrong texture
- General hesitation when picking parts
- Bad initial angle for landing legs
- Right clicked tank instead of landing legs
- Don't hover staging if not going to change it
- Set cone length with diameter
- Don't rotate the view when attaching the fuel lines
- Hesitation at final staging adjustment
- 1.875m nacelles probably worth it for showing cones
- Start w/ 1.5 target TWR
- Use the << button to set top TWR to 1 in one step

# Alternate ideas for animated GIF instead

- No mouse movement or part selection
- Tight editing, only relevant clips included
- KER in-frame to show TWR, always top center?

- Auto fit upper diameter; add tank to:
  1. OKTO
  2. 1.25m pod
  3. 2.5m pod
- Auto fit to cone shapes; start w/ 1.25m pod + tank (zoom to Poodle size, pre-set non-atmospheric and TWR=1)
  1. Add Spark
  2. Add 909
  3. Add Poodle
- Auto fit TWR for w/ 2.5m pod and tank (zoom to Rhino size)
  1. Add Skipper
  2. Add Mainsail
  3. Add Rhino
- Auto fit TWR for crossfed boosters
  1. Add Mainsail to pre-assembled nacelles

- Static images
  - Part right click
  - Settings
